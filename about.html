                <h3>History</h3>

                <p>American Hospital was opened in 2007 as the first private hospital in Tirana, Albania. 
                    The origin facility “Ballkan Alliance” was opened in 2006 and had only 16 beds. 
                    This health center was founded by SEAF whose partners were from Europe and the USA.
                    The organization SEAF managed to invest in this hospital to improve medical,
                    telecommunications, and financial services.
                </p>
           
           
                <p>In the beginning, our hospital was focused on Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery and the doctors 
                    from Ankara and Istambul made these surgeries successful. From their experiences and knowledge, the Albanian doctors
                    took these doctors’ masterpieces to improve our Health Care better.
                   In November 2007, doctors and medicates have done the first transplant of kidneys and from that successful surgery 
                    made this hospital to go bigger and bigger. They did not only invested in this hospital but they also invested in General Surgery, 
                    aesthetics surgeries, gastroenterology, otorhinolaryngology, orthopedics, oncology, ophthalmology and, advanced radiology. 
                    Moreover, they archived to ensure the Coronarography, Coronary Artery Revascularization, and Electrophysiology apertures. 
                    What more important is that they could bring the best specialist from the best-developed countries 
                    to help and intervene in operations successfully.
                   From their greatest achievements, it was possible to make sure that the transports and interventions
                    are highly best and fast to help these medical specialists to save people‘s life.
                    One of the achievements of the cardiologists of this hospital was realizing the Revascularization of 
                    Coronary arteries in an acute condition of myocardial infarctions for the first time in Albania.
